Also: Include a description of alternative way(s) of implementing a timer like this that does not use a Thread object, 
But that also does not block the UI or cause other concurrency problems.

1) I think we can use Stopwatch to implement Timer because it allows to measure the elapsed time between two events in our application.
(Like time when the application starts and time when the application stops) and .NET provides the Stopwatch Class.
2) And we can use Async / Await to avoid blocking the UI or TPL Task Parallel Library.
